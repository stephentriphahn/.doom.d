* Practicalli Doom Emacs Config
A personal configuration for Doom Emacs with a focus on creating a similar key binding and menu experience to that of Spacemacs, as [[https://jr0cket.co.uk/2015/08/spacemacs-first-impressions-from-an-emacs-driven-developer.html][Practicalli has used Spacemacs since 2015]].

** To Archive
Practicalli is not actively developing this configuration, although it should be useable with current versions of Doom Emacs and Emacs 28 onward as it is mostly key binding configuration.

** Overview

Doom Emacs default key bindings have been changed significantly and further changes will be made as this project evolves.  Therefore this configuration is probably not directly applicable for those already comfortable with the Doom Emacs maintainers workflow (although there are quite a few commonalities).


** Notable key binding changes
~+bindings.el~ contains all the additonal, remapped and delete Doom key bindings to provide a more mnemonic menu.  Module specific configurations may also contain key bindings that override the Doom defaults.

The most noticalbe key bindings changed from the Doom Emacs defaults include:

~,~ is set to local leader and ~SPC~ remains the leader key

~SPC TAB~ jumps to previous buffer

~SPC l TAB~ jumps to previously selected workspace (layout in Spacemacs terms)

~SPC g s~ opens Magit status (rather than stage hunk at point)

~fd~ alternative key binding to pressing ~ESC~ key

** Org-mode [1/2]
- [-] Pretty checkboxes [1/2]
  - [X] Added code from practicalli/spacemacs.d
  - [ ] Review why checkbox icons not being used
- [ ] Review org-mode key bindings
  - [ ]  ~, b d~ to add code blocks via babel demarcate

** Screencasts
~SPC t k~ to enable ~keycast-mode~ which shows key bindings and commands in the modeline as you type, exspecially useful for screencasts (or to learn what commands the key bindings are calling)

** Git
For Commit message buffer Doom key binding kept rather than use Spacemacs:
- ~Z Z~ rather than  ~, ,~ to confirm the message and commit
- ~Z Q~  rather than ~, k~ to cancel the message without commit

** Clojure
~+clojure.el~ configuration overrides many CIDER variables defined in the clojure Doom module, as well as adding keybindings similar to the Spacemacs Clojure layer.
